                ("Owner") may authorize users to be managers of the Group Plan ("Managers"). The Owner and Managers can
                see activity and manage accounts for all users of the Group Plan, including adding, pausing, and
                canceling accounts and setting data limits. Each user of the Group Plan ("Member") can manage their own
                account within the limits set by the Owner and Managers, including adding devices, pausing and canceling
                their account, and transferring their phone number(s). If you are the Owner, you agree to be responsible
                for all activities and charges associated with the Group Plan, including charges for all users and
                devices under the Group Plan. If you are not the Owner, you understand and agree that your access to the
                Services depends upon the Owner's compliance with these Terms. You must be at least eighteen years old
                to be the user of an individual account or the Owner or a Manager of a Group Plan with multiple
                accounts, and the Owner and Managers can see such eligibility for all users in Group Plan settings.</p>

              <h3 id="using-the-services">Using the Services</h3>
              <p>In order to use the Services, we require you to first activate your account in the United States and use
                our service primarily in the United States (territories not included). You must subscribe to an active
                voice service plan and keep your Google&nbsp;Fi account in good standing. An account is in good standing when
                all charges for the Services that are due are paid in full and your designated payment method for the
                Services is valid. For more information about the Google&nbsp;Fi services and charges, please see the
                <a href="#google-fi-subscription-information">Subscription Information</a>.
              </p>
              <p>The Services are offered only to residents of the United States. The Services must be primarily used in
                the United States (territories not included) and are not intended for extended international use.
                Further, the Services are designed for use predominantly within our network. If your usage outside our
                network is excessive, abnormally high, or cause us to incur too much cost, we may, at our option and
                sole discretion, suspend your Google&nbsp;Fi account, terminate your service, or limit your use of roaming.</p>
              <p>You agree not to misuse the Services, which includes using the Services for purposes that are illegal,
                are improper, infringe the rights of others, or adversely impact others' enjoyment of the Services. You
                agree to keep your service active. Repeated or extended pausing may result, at our option and sole
                discretion, suspension of your Google&nbsp;Fi account, or limitation of your use of pausing.The Services are
                intended for personal use only, and you may not resell the Services directly or indirectly, except as
                explicitly approved by us in writing. Please see the <a href="#google-fi-acceptable-use-policy">Acceptable Use Policy</a> for more information,
                including examples of misuse.</p>
              <p>Using the Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or
                the content you access. You may not use content you access using the Services unless you obtain
                permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to
                use any branding or logos used in the Services. Don't remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices
                displayed in or along with the Services.</p>
              <h3 id="billing-and-payment">Billing and Payment</h3>
              <p>The Services aren't free, so we do need the following commitments from you if you are responsible for
                paying for the Services (e.g., the user of an individual account or the Owner of a Group Plan with
                multiple accounts):</p>
              <p>You agree to pay all applicable charges for the Services you use, whether ordered by you, someone
                authorized by you, or someone with access to your Services or accounts.</p>
              <p>You agree to pay recurring monthly charges in advance of the billing cycle in which you will receive the
                Services. We will bill one-time charges in the billing cycle following your authorization of such
                charges.</p>
              <p>You authorize us to automatically collect payments of all charges associated with use of the Services
                from your designated payment method. Along with your bill, we will notify you of the date that the
                amount you owe will be collected via your designated payment method. We will send all bills and other
                required notices by email to the address associated with your account. We may also make them available
                in your account via the Google&nbsp;Fi Website or the Google&nbsp;Fi Application. Bills are typically emailed or
                otherwise made available to you one to two days after the end of your billing cycle. We reserve the
                right to amend or correct any bill within 180 days following the date we issue that bill.</p>
              <p>If payment is not received due to insufficient funds or for any other reason, we may, consistent with
                applicable laws, assess late payment fees, suspend, and/or limit the Services. To bring your accounts
                back into good standing, you will be required to pay all outstanding amounts for your services that are
                due and unpaid. We may also terminate your accounts. If we terminate your accounts, any unused services
                will be forfeited. We reserve the right to send unpaid bills to third party collection agencies.</p>
              <p>You must have a valid Google Payments account and use Google Payments for payment transactions relating
                to the Services. If you do not already have a Google Payments account at the time that you sign up for
                the Services, you will be required to create one. Please be aware that your use of Google Payments is

              <h3 id="important-information-about-911-and-emergency-alerts">Important Information about 911 and Emergency Alerts</h3>
              <p><strong>Calling 911.</strong> When making calls to a public-safety answering point (PSAP) from a mobile device, such
                as dialing 911, you should always be prepared to provide your location and your phone number. Unlike
                calls from a traditional wireline phone, a PSAP may not know the emergency caller's location or phone
                number. Although some local emergency authorities have enabled enhanced 911 services ("E911" or
                "Enhanced 911") that use Global Positioning Satellites ("GPS") or other methods to determine callers'
                locations, E911 does not always provide accurate location information. If your mobile device is indoors,
                cannot acquire a satellite signal, or otherwise cannot obtain your location, your location may not be
                automatically delivered to the PSAP. Also, the process of porting a phone number may limit the Services
                such that we may not be able to provide location services to PSAP during that time.</p>
              <p>Calls to 911 over Wi-Fi or a data connection also operate differently than traditional wireline calls to
                911. Calls to 911 over Wi-Fi or data may not connect to the PSAP or may improperly ring to the
                administrative line of the PSAP, which may not be staffed after hours, or by trained 911 operators. If
                your call connects to a PSAP, your location information and phone number may not be transmitted, and you
                may need to provide your location and other information to the PSAP. Calls to 911 may be limited or
                unavailable if your device is set to Wi-Fi only mode and you are experiencing a power outage, any
                disruption in your Wi-Fi service, or if you are otherwise unable to access the Internet. If you would
                like to print a warning label for your device about the limitations of this service, you can view and
                print one
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230809153052/https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/5650A7BD37794B88D5480C22B10F04D159B7">here</a>.
              </p>
              <p>If you are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech disabled and need to reach emergency services, call 911
                directly using TTY or a telecommunications relay service. Where possible, do not rely on 711 in the
                event of an emergency.</p>
              <p>If you have multiple devices associated with your Google&nbsp;Fi number and you make an emergency call to
                911, any calls back to you from the PSAP may ring each of your associated devices.</p>
              <p>Please be aware that, in providing you the Services, we may assign your device other phone numbers in
                addition to your personal phone number. If you make a 911 call, the 911 operator may see a phone number
                that is different from your personal phone number. There may be instances when the PSAP might not be
                able to call you back.</p>
              <p><strong>Place of Primary Use</strong>. In order to use the Services, you are required to register a physical address
                with us that may be used to route emergency calls and services if your location isn't immediately known.
                This address should be the place where you expect to primarily use the Services. It is important that
                you review and update this address as needed. For Group Plans, this address is initially set from the
                Owner's address for all users by default, but you should update this address if your primary place of
                use is different. You can update this address at any time on the Google&nbsp;Fi Website or Google&nbsp;Fi
                Application. You will have to log into your Google&nbsp;Fi account in order to make changes. We will not
                accept P.O. Box addresses. Learn more about updating your place of primary use address

              </p>
              <p><strong>Text-to-911</strong>. Text-to-911 is the ability to send a text message to reach PSAPs from your mobile phone
                or device. Currently, the Services do not support text-to-911 sent over a Wi-Fi network. If your device
                is set to Wi-Fi only mode, you cannot reach PSAPs by sending a text message. In the event of an
                emergency, you should make a voice call (or TTY) to 911 when possible.</p>
              <p><strong>Emergency Alerts</strong>. Emergency alerts can be enabled or disabled in your device settings. Even if
                enabled, Cell Broadcast, Emergency Alert System, and Wireless Priority Services messages are not always
                able to be sent to your device. Be aware that your device may not receive these messages if your device
                is set to Wi-Fi only mode or no cellular signal is available. If you set the device volume to low or
                vibrate only, your device may receive these messages but you may not receive an alert sound. <strong>Emergency
                  Services Outside the United States</strong>. When you are traveling outside the United States, you may not be
                able to reach PSAPs by dialing 911. Where possible, we will attempt to reroute 911 calls to emergency
                services located in the country from which you are calling. Emergency calling is not available in all
                countries and may not be reliable where it is available.</p>
              <h3 id="coverage-and-quality-of-services">Coverage and Quality of Services</h3>
              <p>Our coverage maps only approximate our anticipated wireless coverage area outdoors under optimal
                conditions. The actual service area, coverage, speed, and quality of service may fluctuate based on
                numerous factors such as signal strength, network congestion or capacity, hardware limitations,
                software, server speeds of the websites, portals or other locations on the Internet that you use, the
                weather and any other factors that are beyond our control. Outages and interruptions in the Services may
                occur, and Services, including calls or attempted calls to emergency services like 911 calls, may be
                interrupted or fail. The Services that rely on location information, such as E911 or GPS navigation, may
                depend on network coverage and may depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals
                (typically not available indoors) or cell antenna sites. We do not warrant or guarantee that the
                Services will be available at any specific time or geographic location or that the Services will be
                provided without interruption or at any particular quality level. As we improve the Services, coverage
                maps may change over time.</p>

              <p>The security of your Google&nbsp;Fi account depends on you keeping your Google&nbsp;Account password confidential
                and securing access to your device connected to your account. It is your responsibility to control
                access to your device and your account, including enabling a lock screen on your device and keeping your
                passwords confidential. If you share your account information or device with a third party, they may
                have access to your account and your personal information. It is also your responsibility to alert us if

                violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display Data Content that we reasonably believe
                violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please

              <p>We may modify these Terms and any additional terms that apply to the Services to, for example, reflect

                will provide you with notice of material changes and may provide you notice of non-material changes.
                Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen (14) days after
                they are posted on the Google&nbsp;Fi Website or otherwise made available to you, except that changes
                addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately.

                cancellation, you agree to pay the balance of any outstanding charges remaining at time of cancellation.
                You also agree to pay any additional bill that we provide you after cancellation for charges you
                incurred while your Google&nbsp;Fi accounts were active, but that had not yet been billed to your accounts at
                the time of cancellation. If your accounts are in good standing, depending on your Google&nbsp;Fi plan, we

              <p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230809153052/https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a> applies to all of the services offered
                by Google and its affiliates, including the Services. This Google&nbsp;Fi Privacy Notice provides additional
                information about how we collect and use personal information.</p>
              <h3 id="customer-proprietary-network-information">Customer Proprietary Network Information</h3>
              <p>We take protecting your Customer Proprietary Network Information or "CPNI" very seriously. In fact,
                federal law requires telecommunications providers, like Google&nbsp;Fi, to protect certain personal
                information that we generate or access in providing the Services to you. CPNI includes call details,
                call location information, and information about the rates and features of the Services that you use.
                CPNI does not include your name, address, or phone number. Here are the ways we protect your CPNI:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Securing your CPNI</strong>. We implement safeguards that are designed to protect your CPNI. We must
                  authenticate you with a password or other permissible means before we disclose any CPNI.</li>
                <li><strong>Using CPNI without your additional approval is limited to specific purposes</strong>. By using the
                  Services, you allow us to use, disclose, and permit access to your CPNI without your additional
                  approval only for the following limited purposes:<ul>
                    <li>To provide and offer services among the category of Services you're purchasing from us. This
                      includes using CPNI in the normal course of business, such as to enable billing, customer service,
                      and troubleshooting. This also includes related features such as call blocking, call return, repeat
                      dialing, call waiting, caller ID, and call forwarding.</li>
                    <li>To provide information services, such as Internet access and voicemail.</li>
                    <li>To protect our rights and property.</li>
                    <li>To protect our users and other carriers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses of the Services.</li>
                    <li>Comply with applicable laws and legal process.</li>
                    <li>Any other purpose permitted by federal law.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Using CPNI after you choose to opt in (by default you are opted out)</strong>. From time to time, we may
                  want to provide you information about Google communications- related services that are not among the
                  category of services that you're already purchasing from us. You can opt in to receiving this
                  information. You are not required to opt in and your decision not to opt in will not adversely affect
                  how we provide you the Services that you're purchasing from us. Only if you opt in may we use your
                  CPNI to market you Google communications-related services and share your CPNI with our affiliates and
                  agents in order to provide you those services. Once you opt in, that opt in remains in effect until
                  you affirmatively revoke your opt in or cancel the Services. Learn more about how to manage your
                  opt-in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230809153052/https://support.google.com/fi/answer/6181037">here</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Using CPNI with your additional approval</strong>. Except as provided above, we will not use, disclose, or
                  permit access to your CPNI without your additional approval.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="information-we-collect">Information we collect</h3>
              <p>In providing the Services to you, we may collect other information in addition to CPNI. However, our use
                of that information is also limited to specific purposes related to the Services. We may collect
                information listed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230809153052/https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a> as well as

              <p><strong>Account information</strong>. You may be asked to provide additional personal information, such as billing
                address, service address, or location. Also, in order to prevent unauthorized access to your account,
                we may require you to provide an email address, account password, and answers to security questions
                associated with your account before providing information to you about your account. In some cases, we
                may ask you to provide additional information to verify your identity.</p>
              <p><strong>Network and Device Information</strong>. We may collect information about your use of your mobile devices,
                our network, and the Services. This information includes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage Information</strong>. In providing Services to you, we maintain information about your calls, texts,
                  and data usage, connectivity status, and information about the quantity, technical configuration, and
                  type of the Services you use, as well as some other information found on your bill.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Performance Information</strong>. We may collect information about the performance of the devices
                  you use with the Services, such as any failure of the device to connect with our network, dropped
                  calls, and battery usage.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Data</strong>. When your device is turned on or when you use the Services, we may collect and
                  process information about your actual location. This may include information about your current
                  activity (e.g., driving, running, walking, etc.), which lets us know when you may be moving between
                  different mobile and Wi-Fi networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Wi-Fi Access</strong>. We may collect information about your usage of Wi-Fi services, the Wi-Fi networks
                  that you use, and Wi-Fi networks that may be available to you. This may include information about the
                  credentials you use to connect to Wi-Fi networks.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Pay Monthly Device Plan Information</strong>. When you apply to purchase a device on the Pay Monthly Device
                Plan, we may collect information you provide us in connection with that application, such as your name,
                address, date of birth, Social Security number, or other information. We may ask you to send us
                additional information or to answer additional questions to help verify your identity. We may obtain
                information about you from a credit bureau or other data broker to determine if you meet our minimum
                requirements to qualify for the Pay Monthly Device Plan.</p>
              <p><strong>Marketing Information</strong>. We may obtain and use information (such as commercially available
                demographic, geographic, or interest information) about our users from outside sources for the purposes
                of marketing Google&nbsp;Fi.</p>

                reasonable network management practices. This Network Policy generally describes our network management

              <h3 id="network-management">Network Management</h3>
              <p>We use various network management techniques to protect our network, systems, equipment, services and
                users from harm, ensure reliable, quality services to our users, and improve our services. These network
                management practices can include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Using automated systems to analyze network traffic to detect and prevent the distribution of spam and
                  malware.</li>
                <li>Allocating network resources amongst users and devices in a manner that promotes the best experience

                <li>Limiting or suspending heavy, continuous usage that adversely impacts our network's performance or
                  hinders access to our network. For example, we may automatically terminate any call that exceeds two
                  hours in duration.</li>
                <li>Limiting or suspending usage that we reasonably suspect is unlawful, fraudulent, or does not comply
                  with the <a href="#google-fi-acceptable-use-policy">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</li>
                <li>Restricting access to any telephone number and/or certain categories of telephone numbers (e.g., 9XX

                <li>Not providing calling capability, including connections to certain geographic locations and special

                <li>Limiting data speeds of users who use an excessive amount of data.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>To provide the Services, we also rely on networks, systems, equipment, and services provided by our
                suppliers. Our suppliers may also engage in their own network management techniques to protect their
                networks, systems, equipment, and services from harm, and such network management can impact the

              <p>We require you to first activate your account in the United States and use our service primarily in the

                other networks) at our sole discretion. Whether we allow roaming depends on a number of factors,
                including the radio transmissions that devices can receive. We make no guarantee that roaming coverage
                will be available, and we are not responsible for roaming networks. Depending on your mobile device
                settings, you may automatically roam if there is a gap or interruption in coverage within our network
                area and roaming coverage areas. Limits on the amount of minutes, number of texts, and amount or speed
                of data services used while roaming may be applied. Certain Services or features may not be available in
                roaming coverage areas, and call quality may be lower while roaming. Google&nbsp;Fi reserves the right to
                deny roaming to any device at any time.</p>
              <h3 id="device-management">Device Management</h3>
              <p>You may only use the Services with supported devices. A supported device is a device that conforms to
                all the following requirements:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>does not potentially harm the Services, our network, or our suppliers' networks;</li>
                <li>complies with Federal Communications Commission regulations;</li>
                <li>utilizes an operating system supported by Services; and</li>
                <li>is certified by us for use on our network.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We will list supported devices on the Google&nbsp;Fi Website. Not all supported devices are the same, and the
                Services may perform differently on different devices. Also, some Services may not be available on all
                supported devices and operating systems, and some features will be available only on devices purchased
                from us. Modifications or customizations to your operating system could impact the performance or
                availability of the Services.</p>
              <p>We reserve the right to suspend any device that we reasonably determine is unsupported. Using an
                unsupported device may enable you to use third party services while roaming outside our network. If you
                use such third party services, you are responsible for all third party charges that you incur, and we
                may pass those charges to you as part of your bill. Third party charges may be substantially higher than
                the usage fees we charge for use of the Services within our network.</p>
              <p>We do not allow stolen devices to use the Services and reserve the right to deny providing services to
                any device that has been reported stolen or that we reasonably believe may be stolen.</p>
              <h3 id="telephone-numbers-and-ip-address">Telephone Numbers and IP Address</h3>
              <p>When you sign up for the Services, we may assign you a personal phone number (the "Personal Number"). We
                can change, reassign, or eliminate your Personal Number by giving you notice. We may also assign an
                Internet Protocol address ("IP Address") to your wireless device and can change, reassign, or eliminate
                your IP Address without giving you notice. You may not assign the Personal Number or IP Address to any
                wireless device, other equipment or to any other party except as approved by us.</p>
              <p>In addition to your Personal Number, we may assign your device other phone numbers (each an "Additional Phone Number"). We use these Additional Phone Numbers to operate and manage the Services, and they may not be made apparent to you. We can change, reassign, or eliminate any Additional Phone Number at any time in our discretion without giving you notice.</p>
              <p>You may port your Personal Number to another carrier at any time while your Google&nbsp;Fi account is still active. Please be aware that, once the Personal Number for any device has been ported out, it will no longer be able to use the Services. Consequently, we may treat any request to transfer a Personal Number to another carrier as a request for cancellation. We don't guarantee that any porting of numbers to or from us will be successful.</p>
              <h3 id="software-updates">Software Updates</h3>
              <p>In order to provide you the Services, we provide you software on your device. We may automatically update that software on your device once a new version or feature is available. These changes could affect your stored data or how you have programmed or use your wireless device.</p>
              <p>Google&nbsp;Fi gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by us as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Google&nbsp;Fi, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.</p>
              <p>Open source software is important to us. Some software used in the Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.</p>
              <h3 id="suspected-fraud">Suspected Fraud</h3>
              <p>In certain circumstances, a supplier on which we rely may terminate your Services immediately if that supplier detects fraud. In such circumstances, we do not have control over the termination but will work with you to restore Services if you believe it was done in error. If we suspect fraudulent activity with any of the devices on your Google&nbsp;Fi account, we will notify you of the potential fraud. We may also suspend your device from using some or all of the Services.</p>
              <h3 id="information-about-security">Information about Security</h3>
              <p>We make an effort to keep our network secure, but no network's security is perfect. You should be sure to take whatever steps you believe are necessary to ensure that your data is not accessed by unauthorized third parties. Please be aware of the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Device Storage</strong>. Your device may contain sensitive or personal information. Google&nbsp;Fi is not responsible for any information on your device, including sensitive or personal information. You should remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive or personal information when your device is out of your possession or control, including, but not limited to, relinquishing, exchanging, returning, or recycling your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Applications</strong>. Use of applications or services provided, offered, and/or controlled by someone other than Google&nbsp;Fi ("Third Party Applications") is not governed by these Terms and may be subject to separate agreement between you and the third party provider. Third Party Applications may access, collect, use, or disclose your personal information, including location information, as a result of your agreement to the installation and use of those applications. Google&nbsp;Fi has no responsibility for Third Party Applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Unauthorized Interception</strong>. Although it may be illegal for unauthorized people to intercept wireless device calls intended for others, Google&nbsp;Fi cannot guarantee the complete privacy of your calls. Wireless calls by nature may be intercepted by third parties. GOOGLE FI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INTERCEPTION BY THIRD PARTIES OF COMMUNICATIONS FROM ITS SYSTEM.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="copyright-issues">Copyright Issues</h3>

              <p>Descriptions of the Services are provided below. As we are constantly changing and improving our Services, we may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether at any time, in our sole discretion. We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service. All Services are subject to our network management practices. Please note that the features of the Services may not be the same as the features of the services offered by our suppliers.</p>
              <p>Calls &amp; texts. Calls &amp; texts are available for a recurring flat monthly fee and provides the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Unlimited number of voice minutes within the United States.</li>
                <li>Unlimited Wi-Fi calling within the United States.</li>
                <li>Unlimited Wi-Fi calling to the United States when you travel in certain countries.</li>
                <li>Unlimited number of SMS and MMS texts within the United States and the Supported Countries and Territories.</li>
                <li>24/7 Live Support.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you have multiple devices associated with your Google&nbsp;Fi number, your unlimited calling and texting capabilities may be limited to your calls &amp; texts Device.</p>
              <p>The Supported Countries and Territories are those countries where Google&nbsp;Fi makes its Services available for use when you are traveling in those countries. Over time, we may include additional countries within the Supported Countries and Territories. We may also remove countries at any time. We provide a list of the Supported Countries and Territories on the Google&nbsp;Fi Website.</p>
              <p><strong>Data Usage</strong>. Data usage includes web browsing, application usage, downloading content (like applications, games, etc.), ringtones and similar activities. If applications running in the background use your data connection, such usage will be accounted as part of your data usage. Data usage is available to you as follows:</p>
              <p>Depending on your Google&nbsp;Fi plan, we may charge you for unlimited data usage in advance of your data usage, or we may charge you for data you have used in 1 MB increments. For plans with unlimited data usage, certain categories of data usage like video may be managed at a particular speed or resolution. For plans with Bill Protection, we will not charge you for data usage beyond certain amounts, which depend on the number of users in your plan. For all plans, users who exceed a specified amount of data usage (across all their devices) will have their data speeds slowed for the remainder of their billing cycle, unless they opt out and choose to be charged for additional data usage at full speeds.</p>
              <p><strong>International Calling</strong>. Wi-Fi calling to the United States is included as part of calls &amp; texts without an additional fee. All other calls between two different countries (such as cellular calls placed between the United States and another country and Wi-Fi calls between non-US countries) will be charged on a rate per minute basis. Calls will be rounded up to the nearest minute, unless your Google&nbsp;Fi plan provides otherwise. The applicable rates vary per country.</p>
              <h3 id="about-usage-fees-for-services">About Usage Fees for Services</h3>
              <p>We will provide information about our usage fees and rates on the Google&nbsp;Fi Website or the Google&nbsp;Fi Application. The details, prices, and allowances of the Services may change at any time. The type of fees that you incur will vary depending on the Services you choose to use.</p>
              <p>We charge three different types of usage fees for the Services:</p>
              <p><strong>Monthly Recurring Fees</strong>. Some Services, like calls &amp; texts, are available for a monthly recurring fee. For any Services with a recurring monthly fee, those fees must be paid in advance of the month in which you will receive the Services. If a monthly recurring fee for a Service that you have subscribed to is changed, the change will be effective at the next billing cycle, and you will receive notification of the pending change.</p>
              <p><strong>One-Time Fees</strong>. Some Services, like calls from the United States to other countries, are available for a specific fee or rate per use. We will bill one-time charges in the next billing cycle following your authorization of such charges. There may be some instances, due to delay in our systems, where the charges appear in a later billing cycle.</p>
              <p><strong>Additional Fees</strong>. Depending upon the Services used by you, there may be additional charges for calls to or from certain locations, including without limitation payphones and areas within extended calling zones. There may also be applicable charges for any special or enhanced services you use.</p>
              <h3 id="about-taxes-surcharges-and-other-fees">About Taxes, Surcharges, and Other Fees</h3>
              <p>In addition to usage fees, you agree to pay all applicable taxes, surcharges, and other fees.</p>
              <p>A Note about Surcharges. Surcharges are not taxes, and we are not required by law to assess them. We choose, in our discretion, to collect surcharges from you to recover certain costs. We determine the amount of each surcharge, and that amount is subject to change without notice, as are the components used to calculate that amount. Examples of surcharges include, but are not limited to, Federal and State Universal Service fees, and regulatory and administrative fees.</p>
              <h3 id="managing-your-google-fi-account">Managing Your Google&nbsp;Fi Account</h3>
              <p><strong>Billing Cycles</strong>. If you are responsible for paying for the Services (e.g., the user of an individual account or the Owner of a Group Plan with multiple accounts), when you first establish your Google&nbsp;Fi account, you will approve your initial purchase of monthly recurring fees and authorize automatic monthly charges via Google Payments. Your billing cycle for all subsequent months will commence on the day that you activate the first device on your Google&nbsp;Fi account plus two days (the "Cycle Start Day"), except that if that day falls on the 1st, 28th, 29th, 30th, or 31st of any month, in which case your Cycle Start Day will be moved forward to the 2nd of all subsequent months. For example, if the activation of the first device on your account occurs on March 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30, your Cycle Start Day will be April 2nd. Subsequent monthly billing cycles will automatically renew on the Cycle Start Day of each subsequent month.</p>
              <p><strong>Disputing Charges</strong>. If you believe you were incorrectly charged by us, you must dispute those charges in writing within 180 days of the date we charge your account. You accept all charges not properly disputed within the above time period.</p>
              <p><strong>Lost or Stolen Devices</strong>. If your device is lost or stolen, notify us immediately by calling customer support. We reserve the right to hold you liable for all charges and fees incurred by your device until you have notified us of the alleged loss or theft and until such time as we can deactivate the device. If we choose to investigate a lost or stolen device, you agree to cooperate in our investigation. Once a device is reasonably determined to be lost or stolen, we may report the device to third party services that track lost or stolen devices and prevent service from being activated on the device.</p>
              <h3 id="suspension-and-termination-of-your-google-fi-account">Suspension and Termination of Your Google&nbsp;Fi Account</h3>
              <p>In certain circumstances, we may suspend or terminate your Google&nbsp;Fi account in accordance with these Terms. For example, we may suspend or terminate your account if there is a late payment, suspected fraud, or we determine there is a violation of these Terms. We may also suspend or terminate your account if your Google&nbsp;Account or Google Payments account is suspended or terminated. If your Google&nbsp;Fi account is suspended for any reason, you cannot make use of the Services for any purpose except for placing calls to emergency services. When your account is terminated, all devices will be disassociated from your account and may permanently lose the current telephone numbers associated with such devices. Even if you later bring your account into good standing, we will likely not be able to provide you with the telephone numbers that were associated with your devices prior to when your account was terminated.</p>

              <h3 id="general-description-of-the-benefit">General Description of the Benefit</h3>
              <p>1 Year of YouTube&nbsp;Premium is a benefit that provides each eligible member on a Fi Unlimited Plus service plan individual access to a 1 year trial of YouTube&nbsp;Premium, at no additional charge. Each Fi member's Benefit begins on the date on which they complete their initiation of the Benefit through the web-based claim process, and each member's Benefit ends after one calendar year.</p>
              <p>Fi plan members who have claimed the Benefit may cancel their access to YouTube&nbsp;Premium at any time by visiting their <a href="/web/20230809153052/https://fi.google.com/signup#plan">Fi plans page</a>.</p>
              <p>At the conclusion of each member's 1 year trial of YouTube&nbsp;Premium access, that member will be automatically enrolled in an individual monthly subscription to YouTube&nbsp;Premium at the then current rate (currently $11.99/mo, subject to change), as an optional add-on to their Fi plan. This subscription will be charged to the Fi account and is the responsibility of the Fi plan owner. Fi plan owners may disable the automatic renewal of their members to a paid subscription to YouTube&nbsp;Premium at any time, by visiting their <a href="/web/20230809153052/https://fi.google.com/signup#plan">Fi plans page</a> without affecting the nature or duration of the Benefit for their members.

              <p>To be eligible to claim the Benefit, each Fi member must meet the eligibility criteria for paid individual access to YouTube&nbsp;Premium. Please refer to the YouTube <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230809153052/https://www.youtube.com/t/terms_paidservice">Paid Service Terms of Services</a> for additional details. Fi members under 13 years of age and Fi members subscribed on a Google Workspace account with YouTube access disabled will not be eligible to claim the Benefit.</p>
              <p>If you are under 18, you represent that you have your parent or guardian's permission to use YouTube&nbsp;Premium. Please have them read these Terms with you.</p>
              <p>If you are a parent or legal guardian of a Fi member under the age of 18, by allowing your child to use YouTube&nbsp;Premium, you are subject to these Terms and you are responsible for your child's activity on YouTube&nbsp;Premium.</p>
